# Risk Analysis

The goal with this project is to create a program that analysis the risk of a crypto trading account. I will focus on creating it for the futures market given that to me it needs to monitor my algos' risk parameters.

Add a .env file and its structure should be this:

    api_key = "abc"
    api_secret = "xyz"

The ratios and other calculations are not complete and actually pretty wrong.
